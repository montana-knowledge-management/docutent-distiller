Moore's law
-----------

Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC)
doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend.
Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in
production.
